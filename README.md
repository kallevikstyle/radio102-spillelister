# radio102-spillelister
A small web app used to aid manual adjustment of playlists to a user input amount of hours for the radio station at which I work. The program corresponds to music schedules imported into Log Editor in the broadcasting software Dalet.

## Use case
The user will first select a time span that corresponds to the radio station's music schedule that is going to be time adjusted. On the next screen the user inputs the pre imported durations from Dalet for each hour in the selected time span. 
When clicking the Beregn button, the program will calculate how muck playtime the user will have to cut from, or add to, the total duration, in order to reach the correct duration for the set amount of hours.
